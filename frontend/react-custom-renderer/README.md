# React custom renderer

React custom renderers experiments.

- **ReactSpeech**: a renderer which transforms components to speech using `say` comand
- ReactTinyDOM: a minimal implementation of `react-dom`. The work continued in a separate repository [react-tiny-dom](https://github.com/jiayihu/react-tiny-dom)
